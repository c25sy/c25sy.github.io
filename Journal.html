During my first few weeks of Computer Science, I have experienced a lot of new things, and I have tried to take in as much as I could have. So far I have explored a lot of different features, and have learned the importance of colons, semi-colons, quotations, hashtags, period’s, etc which have extremely different meanings in the English language than they do in html. I am really enjoying this class, as I can explore something totally different to what I have ever done before, and there are no consequences if I do something that I hadn’t planned on, or initially hoped for. I am working on the links for my journal and projects, and am currently struggling with the exact details of it. In the next week or two, I want to start a project after setting up the basics of my website.

 During the HW for today, I learned what a function is. A function is something that runs a task. A variable is something that contains large amount of data that refers to a certain element. I can make a function run by opening the website. Some javascript words that I have learnt are: variable, document, interval, function, and the child parent relationships. I used my function for repeating an image.

During class today I am going to work on making my website more coherent and improve the flow of my website. I want everything to be color-coordinated, and for it to look nicer. I still need to work on my gift project, and need to continue working on it. For that project I need to use a bunch of different div tags including different pictures that have special meanings to me and him.

Somethings I have learnt from reading the articles about JavaScript and RGB colors are that JavaScript is a "compact, yet very flexible" coding language. JavaScript is often used to add interactivity for a website. RGB stands for the primary colors: red, green, and blue, and they are the basic colors used for displaying images onto a screen. Each pixel has a subunit for each of the three RGB colors. These primary colors allow us to see any color.

My gift before winter break is going to be for my father. Us two bond over soccer, and I want to recognize that by creating an animation of us two kicking a ball back and forth. When I click on myself, the ball will move to me, when I click on him, the ball will move to him. I am going to use JavaScript to make an eventListener to make that happen. My background will be a div of a soccer field, with div's of me and my father on top of it.
