During my first few weeks of Computer Science, I have experienced a lot of new things, and I have tried to take in as much as I could have. So far I have explored a lot of different features, and have learned the importance of colons, semi-colons, quotations, hashtags, period’s, etc which have extremely different meanings in the English language than they do in html. I am really enjoying this class, as I can explore something totally different to what I have ever done before, and there are no consequences if I do something that I hadn’t planned on, or initially hoped for. I am working on the links for my journal and projects, and am currently struggling with the exact details of it. In the next week or two, I want to start a project after setting up the basics of my website.

 During the HW for today, I learned what a function is. A function is something that runs a task. A variable is something that contains large amount of data that refers to a certain element. I can make a function run by opening the website. Some javascript words that I have learnt are: variable, document, interval, function, and the child parent relationships. I used my function for repeating an image.
